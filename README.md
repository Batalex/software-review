# pyOpenSci Software Peer Review

This repo hosts the pyOpenSci review process. Packages contributed to pyOpenSci undergo an open peer-review by community reviewers. 

If you are interested in submitting a package, check out our [guidebook](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/intro.html) for info about how to package your code and submit a request for review. For authors, the most important sections are the [scope of pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/aims_scope.html), the [author guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/author_guide.html), and the [packaging guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/packaging/packaging_guide.html). For details about the exact timeline and process of peer-review, see [this section](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/peer_review_proc.html).

When you are ready to submit for review, fill out the [Submission template](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-software-for-review.md&title=). 

If your package is not yet fully-developed or you're not sure whether it fits within pyOpenSci's [scope](https://www.pyopensci.org/dev_guide/peer_review/aims_scope.html), you can create a [presubmission inquiry issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=presubmission-inquiry.md&title=).
