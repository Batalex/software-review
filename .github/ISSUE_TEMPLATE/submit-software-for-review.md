- [ ] The package has an **obvious research application** according to JOSS's definition in their [submission requirements](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#submission-requirements). Be aware that completing the pyOpenSci review process **does not** guarantee acceptance to JOSS. Be sure to read their submission requirements (linked above) if you are interested in submitting to JOSS.
